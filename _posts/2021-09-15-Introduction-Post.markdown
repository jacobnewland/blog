##Hello everyone!
####Welcome to my blog.  
I hope to make some great posts here.  This lab wasn't *too* much trouble for me, but I did get stuck at the end of step 3.  I didn't understand that I needed to type "cd" and then the filename I used for this blog in order to execute the 'bundle install' command.  I tried searching through:
- [Gitkraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/)
- [Atom](https://atom.io/)
- [Lab 3's instructions](https://hendrix-cs.github.io/csci340/labs/jekyll.html)
- The command prompt
and unfortunately, I couldn't figure it out.  Luckily, on my way to ask Dr. Goadrich about it, my friend Garrett noticed my struggles and helped me.  Thanks, Garrett!  Other than this one little problem, this lab was quite straightforward to me.  Jekyll and Ruby are both completely new to me and the only practice I've had with Atom, GitKraken, and Git as a whole are labs one and two, so most of this is new to me, but I feel like I'm learning a lot and making great progress.  I think everything here makes sense to me.  I'm looking forward to applying these skills I'm learning towards helping Indivisible Arkansas!
####Thanks for reading!
