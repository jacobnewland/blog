## Hello everyone!

This lab was also nice and straightforward for me.  My biggest struggle was figuring out the right interpretation of Jekyll's [tutorial](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/#overriding-theme-defaults) for how to find the files within the minima gem I needed to copy and then how to actually copy the file itself instead of firefox's interpretation of the file.  Messing with the root files was new for me.  I've mostly ignored them since the start of the lab and I'm glad to now have some understanding of them.  Something a little confusing is the link to our [CSCI 340](https://hendrix-cs.github.io/csci340/index.html) site in the navigation bar.  I'm *pretty sure* I've put it in the right place, but it's above the other items in the nav bar.  It seems right to me, but I'm not certain.  I'm looking forward to becoming a more effective computer scientist and contributing as much as I can for my team in our project.  Anyway, with all of this backpacking talk, I'd like to show you two pictures from my backpacking trip in the Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument.  Here you can see my girlfriend Keira and I out in a

with face masks on to keep the sand out of our noses.  Over here, we've got
[Broken Bow Arch](broken_bow.jpg)
, a beautiful arch that was carved by wind.  That's actually what makes it an arch.  Holes in the rock that are carved by wind are called arches and holes carved by water are called natural bridges.  I hope you liked them!  

### Thanks for reading!
