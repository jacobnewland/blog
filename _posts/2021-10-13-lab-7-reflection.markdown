Good lord, lab 7 has been giving me some trouble.  While Microsoft Visual Studio has been behaving just fine for me, Github keeps giving me a fatal error every time I try to push a commit.  I have absolutely no idea why it's giving me such an error, but I suspect it's that I named both my GitHub repo and my Razor Site csci340lab7.  As much as I'd like to show you my trail data, I'm afraid [my repository](https://github.com/jacobnewland/csci340lab7) doesn't have anything interesting.  I will work to solve this issue and will later update this blog post once this is done.  

Anyway, I'll discuss the tutorial here, too.  Of course, the sections where I was copy/pasting code and testing my CRUD features were the easiest parts of the tutorial.  Sometimes, when I was told to find some file, it was difficult to find if it didn't give me the entire address, though I always ended up finding it.  Jekyll and Razor both have MANY files that all affect each other, but Razor has some interesting consoles that I can type commands in to.  I can't quite put my finger on why, but Razor also makes it feel like I have more control over this site, which is strange to me because Jekyll feels more intuitive.  I think that at the moment, I prefer Jekyll because I'm more familiar with it, but I can tell Razor has a lot of potential.  I would say I feel confident about making another Razor page, but I'm worried about Github.  I'm nervous about this error and want to resolve it ASAP.

I'm back!  I've finished Lab 7 without too much trouble.  I don't know what kind of problem Github had.  I assume I opened the wrong file somewhere once and Github was unhappy with it.  Whatever the problem was, Github has behaved ever since.  This attempt at the lab went relatively smoothly.  I got stuck in a couple spots with errors, but fixed them rather quickly.  I accidentally put a string minimum length on my trail length integer, but figured that out and solved it.  The validation fields were probably the most confusing things to translate, but that still went pretty smoothly for me.  I feel like the Razor Pages framework gives me more to work with and I like that I have more built in commands and tools, or at least it feels like it.  I feel pretty confident making another Razor Page for this class as long as I have a guide informing me about the built in features.  I'll possibly revisit this tutorial or the one in lab 8 while I work on our project site.
