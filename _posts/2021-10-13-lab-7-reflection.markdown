Good lord, lab 7 has been giving me some trouble.  While Microsoft Visual Studio has been behaving just fine for me, Github keeps giving me a fatal error every time I try to push a commit.  I have absolutely no idea why it's giving me such an error, but I suspect it's that I named both my GitHub repo and my Razor Site csci340lab7.  As much as I'd like to show you my trail data, I'm afraid [my repository](https://github.com/jacobnewland/csci340lab7) doesn't have anything interesting.  I will work to solve this issue and will later update this blog post once this is done.  

Anyway, I'll discuss the tutorial here, too.  Of course, the sections where I was copy/pasting code and testing my CRUD features were the easiest parts of the tutorial.  Sometimes, when I was told to find some file, it was difficult to find if it didn't give me the entire address, though I always ended up finding it.  Jekyll and Razor both have MANY files that all affect each other, but Razor has some interesting consoles that I can type commands in to.  I can't quite put my finger on why, but Razor also makes it feel like I have more control over this site, which is strange to me because Jekyll feels more intuitive.  I think that at the moment, I prefer Jekyll because I'm more familiar with it, but I can tell Razor has a lot of potential.  I would say I feel confident about making another Razor page, but I'm worried about Github.  I'm nervous about this error and want to resolve it ASAP.
