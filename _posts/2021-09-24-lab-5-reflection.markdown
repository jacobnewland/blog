## Hello everyone!

In this grocery store example, I had to make several assumptions.  Firstly, I assumed that every item had only one manufacturer.  This could turn out not to be true in the case of produce, where say Idaho potatoes from different farms could be mixed together into one basket, but I thought a responsible grocery store would keep track of this in case of recalls.  I also assumed every item had only one name.  This could also turn out to not be true in the case of eggplants/aubergines, but I assumed the tag on the shelf would choose only one of these names instead of both.  I also made the assumption that the grocery store only had one owner instead of several partners splitting ownership.  I assumed only one of the owners would be in charge of listing items.  Below, you can see my entity-relationship diagram
